# ðŸ’§ Safe H2O - Smart Water Contamination Detection using Machine Learning

Safe H2O is a machine learning-based solution designed to analyze and predict the quality of water samples. It helps identify whether water is safe or contaminated using key chemical and physical indicators. Developed during the GDG Hackathon by Team Khaleja, this project is a step toward real-world deployment using AI and IoT.
