#💧 SafeH2O - Water Quality Classification App

SafeH2O is a machine learning web app built using Streamlit that classifies whether a water sample is safe or not based on physicochemical parameters. It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a public dataset and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to check water quality.
